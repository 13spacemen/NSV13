changes:
  - rscadd: Doing things that annoy the Syndicate will now slowly make them allocate
      more forces to your part of the region, resulting in increasingly more dangerous
      encounters the longer you do such.
  - rscadd: Enemy fleets when untouched for a long time can now request reinforcements
      up to the fleet's intended size.
