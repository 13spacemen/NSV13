changes: 
  - code_imp: "overmap structures no longer have their Destroy() split into multiple files."
  - code_imp: "AI now is alot more efficient with targetting and simillar by only iterating through the contents of their system, not through EVERY overmap object."
  - rscadd: "Lances, groups of ships that generally work together on something within a fleet. Not useful alone, but together with a fitting AI goal managing the lance, they can be pretty scary."
  - rscadd: "The Swarmer AI goal: Fighters / Bombers with this goal will form lances and somewhat cooperate on hunting down hostiles."
  - rscadd: "The Patrol AI goal: This is used by Destroyers and Supply ships when they have nothing better to do, patrolling the sector slowly."
  - balance: "Supply ships now resupply allies much much faster. Repairs still need some time though, depending on damage."
  - balance: "Sensor ranges & Pings have had some big changes. Ships very far away are completely invisible to the dradis unless pinging, pinging ships reveal themselves as far as their extended scanning range goes and friendlies will always show up on the dradis."
  - balance: "Allies (and you) will now always arrive on the left side of the map, enemies always on the right."
  - tweak: "Some AIgoals have been tweaked to work better and to not cause issues with the two newly added goals."
  - tweak: "Fighters are now Swarmers, and not flyswatters AI-wise."
  - tweak: "Bombers are now Swarmers and Destroyers AI-wise.
fix; Fixed a few minor things causing runtimes. Aswell as a check in the dradis code not working as intended."
  - bugfix: "Fixed even more random stuff that has to do with AI code and starsystem code, too much to list."
