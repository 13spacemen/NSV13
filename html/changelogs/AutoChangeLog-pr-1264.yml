changes: 
  - bugfix: "Fleets should no longer sometimes be undefeatable due to ships stuck in nullspace."
  - bugfix: "Encountering an enemy will no longer force your alert level down to general quarters if it is higher."
  - code_imp: "Somewhat changed how fleets assemble themselves aswell as how they move."
  - balance: "Fleets that are defeated outside of systems with players in them no longer modify influence (aka patrol completion)"
  - balance: "Pirate fleets are now worth less influence due to them being very easy to defeat."
