changes: 
  - rscadd: "Master at arms now gets a console to better keep track of / control the fighters. Traitors can emag this to remove its access restriction."
  - rscdel: "Fighters can no longer fire their weapons when on the main ship without the MAA giving them firing authorisation via his console"
  - rscadd: "Fighters are now much harder to fly in pressurized environments. If you don't keep your speed up, you scrape along the floor and damage your fighter."
  - rscadd: "I've remedied an issue causing fighters to be able to squeeze through 1 tile doors. They have also now lost their ability to open doors by default"
  - rscadd: "Emagging a fighter lets you shoot its guns ANYWHERE you like. It also removes it from the MAA's fighter tracking console, at the cost of marking you as clearly hostile on DRADIS, and allowing any other fighter (Even other emagged ones, or Syndicate ones!) to fire on you, and vice versa."
  - rscadd: "Fighters now take a huge amount of damage from EMPs, specifically, the ION rifle is extra good at dealing with them now."
