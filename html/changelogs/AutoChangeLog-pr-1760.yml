changes:
  - rscadd: Allows small craft to dock with asteroids.
  - tweak: Fighters entering the overmap will end up somewhat near the overmap they
      just left.
  - tweak: FTL-capable fighters can only use their FTL to return to the main ship,
      not move away from it.
  - bugfix: Fighters start with a little bit of fuel again.
  - code_imp: New overmap deletion mechanics. See the nsv13/__DEFINES/overmap.dm file
      for details.
  - code_imp: Overmap objects maintain a list of smaller ships that are docked to
      them, in case that affects whether we want to delete them.
